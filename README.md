GPT-ChatBot: Conversational AI with Custom-Built GPT
Overview

The GPT-ChatBot project is an open-source initiative that brings together the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and a custom chatbot. Our goal is to create an accessible and customizable conversational AI system that can be fine-tuned for various applications.
Key Features

    Custom GPT Model:
        Weâ€™ve developed a GPT model from scratch using PyTorch (or TensorFlow, depending on your preference).
        Unlike pre-trained models, our GPT-ChatBot allows you to tailor the architecture, tokenization, and training process to your specific needs.

    Chatbot Integration:
        The GPT-ChatBot seamlessly integrates with your existing applications or platforms.
        Users can interact with the chatbot via text input, making it suitable for web applications, customer support, virtual assistants, and more.

    Fine-Tuning Capabilities:
        Fine-tune the GPT model on your domain-specific data to enhance its conversational abilities.
        Use transfer learning to adapt the model to specific tasks or industries.

    Easy Deployment:
        Deploy the GPT-ChatBot on cloud servers, edge devices, or even as a web service.
        We provide deployment scripts and guidelines for various platforms.
